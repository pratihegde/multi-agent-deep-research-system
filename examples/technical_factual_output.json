  "query": "What are the main causes of inflation and how do central banks respond?",
  "executive_summary": "As of 2025-2026, global inflation is entering a 'normalization' phase but remains sensitive to supply-side shocks and services-sector persistence. Central banks, specifically the Federal Reserve and the ECB, have transitioned from aggressive tightening to a data-dependent neutral stance. The Fed is managing a 3.5%–3.75% rate environment to counter persistent PCE inflation (projected 2.2% in 2026), while the ECB has lowered its deposit facility to 2.0% as headline inflation nears its 1.9%-2.0% target. Policy responses are now focused on 'fine-tuning' and managing the trade-offs between labor market stability and the final mile of price stabilization.",
  "report": "Context\n-------\nThis query synthesizes core inflation drivers and the evolving policy responses of major central banks as they navigate the post-2023 recovery period.\n\nFindings by Sub-Question\n------------------------\n- Primary drivers include services-sector inflation lags, supply-side vulnerabilities (including new tariffs), and anchored but sensitive expectations [S1][S2].\n- The Federal Reserve maintains a target range of 3.50–3.75%, balancing solid growth with a projected PCE index of 2.2% through 2026 [S3].\n- The European Central Bank (ECB) projects headline inflation to reach 1.9% in 2026, utilizing a deposit facility rate of 2.00% to achieve medium-term stability [S4].\n- Central banks are increasingly utilizing 'forward guidance' to prevent a premature easing of financial conditions before targets are fully met [S1].\n\nContradictions and Gaps\n-----------------------\n- There is divergence on the impact of secondary supply shocks (e.g., energy/tariffs) vs. domestic demand as the primary driver of late-stage inflation.\n- The 'neutral rate' (r*) is currently under debate; it is unclear if structurally higher rates are the new permanent baseline.\n\nActionable Takeaways\n--------------------\n- Monitor 'Services Inflation' as the most persistent component in the 2025-2026 cycle.\n- Track the Fed's PCE targets vs. actuals for early indicators of policy shifts toward 3.25% in late 2026.\n\nLimitations and Assumptions\n---------------------------\n- Analysis assumes no major escalation in global trade wars beyond currently enacted or announced tariffs as of February 2026.",
