  "query": "Should a mid-sized fintech expand into Southeast Asia in 2026?",
  "executive_summary": "The Southeast Asian fintech market is projected to surpass $1 trillion in 2025, with growth accelerating into 2026 driven by the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA). While demand for digital lending (+40% growth) and payments (+20%) is surging, the regulatory landscape is tightening. Singapore remains the regional hub with stringent new stablecoin capital requirements (S$1M), while Malaysia and the Philippines are maturing their regulatory sandboxes. Expansion in 2026 is highly recommended, provided the firm aligns with regional interoperability standards and cross-border payment connectivity (RPC).",
  "report": "Context\n-------\nThe query evaluates market-entry viability for a mid-sized fintech expansion into Southeast Asia (ASEAN) in 2026.\n\nFindings by Sub-Question\n------------------------\n- The total fintech market is expected to reach $1.073 trillion by 2025, driven by mobile-first digital adoption [S1].\n- Singapore's MAS is implementing a 2026 framework for single-currency stablecoins requiring S$1M in capital [S2].\n- Malaysia's Bank Negara (BNM) is prioritizing Ringgit stablecoins and tokenized deposits as part of its 2026 strategy [S3].\n- The ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA), slated for 2026, will harmonize digital trade and financial standards [S4].\n\nContradictions and Gaps\n-----------------------\n- There is high variability in regulatory maturity; Philippines and Vietnam focus on inclusion vs. Singapore’s focus on stability.\n- Public data on local fraud loss controls and specific CAC for mid-market fintechs is remains sparse.\n\nActionable Takeaways\n--------------------\n- Target Singapore for high-value wealth/stablecoin operations or Malaysia for regulated sandbox testing.\n- Ensure technical stacks support ASEAN Regional Payment Connectivity (RPC) for seamless cross-border settlement.\n\nLimitations and Assumptions\n---------------------------\n- Analysis assumes the 2026 DEFA signing proceeds on schedule and that geopolitical stability in the South China Sea remains constant.",
